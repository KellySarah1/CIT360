      <p id = "summary p">The first week of the course, we studied about the Ophelia Syndrome. I didn’t know how the topic could relate to the course. However, after finishing the course, Ophelia Syndrome not only applied to it, but it also applied to me. The Journal Report will talk about different points made about Ophelia Syndrome which are: Seek Out and Learn from Great Teachers, Dare to Know and Trust Yourself, Practice Dialectical Thinking, Foster Idle Thinking, and Plan to Step Out Of Bounds. </p>

    <h2>Journal Report</h2>
    <h3>What is Ophelia Syndrome?</h3>
    <p>Ophelia is a character from <i> Hamlet </i> who didn't know how to think for herself. She wanted someone to tell her how to think. The Ophelia Syndrome is to copy someone or think just like someone instead of thinking for yourself. In the article, <i>Diagnosing and Treating the Ophelia Syndrome</i> By Thomas G. Plummer, it states, “Individuation is the process of learning to differentiate oneself from others. It is a psychological “growing up.” It means to discover those aspects of the self that distinguish one person from another. Failure to achieve individuation leaves people dependent on other, stronger personalities for their identity. They
       fail to understand their uniqueness.” </p>

  <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
    <h3>Seek Out and Learn from Great Teachers, Regardless of What They Teach.</h3>
    <p>I had a great teacher for this course and I felt that I connected with him. I learned that it is important to have continuous communication with your “boss” because you can know what they require and be able to understand each other. Dr. Plummer stated, “How do you find them? First of all, they have a reputation among students. They are known to set people on fire, to inspire them. They are known to be challenging, fair, and tough. They refuse to be a Polonius, they refuse to make you a baby, and they refuse to do your thinking for you. They join you as a partner in a learning and research enterprise.” I felt that my teacher was very helpful. The course was designed to be challenging and refuse to think for you. This helped me grow because I had to come up with my own ideas and ways to complete the assignments. </p>

    <h3>Dare to Know and Trust Yourself</h3>
    <p>Before I was a CIT major, I was a music major. I had played the piano and sang since I was 5 years old. I was classically trained for 14 years by a retired Ricks College piano instructor. During those years, I composed several songs, which one was performed in Disneyland by a live orchestra. I had one piano several competitions and accompanied several musicians including 4 musicals. My first semester of college, I decided to become a jazz pianist and eventually become a composer for movies/shows. However, they decided me for being a jazz pianist because the scholarships were for classical piano. I then continued training in classical, but unfortunately, I got tendinitis, which I had to completely stop. I tried for voice, but I didn’t have enough confidence in myself, even though my teachers thought I would be great. So, I quit being a music major. I went ahead and got an associate in science and served a mission in Chile. When I came back, I only had 3 days to decide what my major would be. I scrolled through the major list and picked CIT just to try it out. It was hard at first because I had no background in IT. During this time, I really had to trust myself and “Dare to Know” all the CIT concepts. Dr. Plummer stated, “As you come to know yourself and gain confidence in critical skills, you must also learn to play your hunches, to follow your intuition through. You truly are the only one who knows what you think and feel, and you, consequently are the only one who knows what feelings and ideas you must follow through on.” Now as a senior, I have a 3.98 GPA, a fulltime job in USAA, was the Linux Society President, and about to graduate. It was a challenge, but well worth it! </p>

  <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
    <h3>Practice Dialectical Thinking </h3>
    <p>For CIT360, we had to work closely with a team to create a project using a methodology and meet a few times during the week. I was familiar with this concept since I had internships with USAA in Business Intelligence, and the LDS Church in Information Security.  I learned it is important to work in a team and especially be opened to new ideas. Everyone has a different background and knowledge. Dr. Plummer stated, “Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg defines morality as the ability to see an issue from points of view other than just your own. He cites E.M. Forster’s observation that most of the trouble in the world is due to our “inability to imagine the innerness of other lives.” Throughout this class, we listened to each other’s ideas and views for the project and it came out nicely. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
    <h3>Foster Idle Thinking</h3>
    <p>I believe that Foster Idle Thinking is essential in being creative and successful. I admit, I may think idly too much, but I can build on other ideas or concepts. During a class lecture, I “tune out” and ponder on what is being taught. I then come up with several questions which teaches me even more deeply. I believe this is what BYUI wants for the students, to “ponder and prove”. Dr. Plummer stated,” Idle thinking frees the mind for creative ideas. Hayakawa suggests that the creative person “is able to entertain and play with ideas that the average person may regard as silly, mistaken, or downright dangerous.” I had quite a bit of idle thinking for this Journal Report assignment. I could come up with ideas and designs for it. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
    <h3>Plan to Step Out Of Bounds</h3>
    <p>In my experience, this class had us Step Out of bounds to complete. It was certainly confusing at first, since there was no clear outline or deadlines. I had to step out of my comfort zone to complete the coding topics and other assignments. Dr. Plummer clarifies, “By ‘out of bounds,’ I mean out of the limits that Polonius may have prescribed for you. Independent thinking means to question the presumed bounds of thinking, reading, writing, or learning in general. A colleague at BYU once told me that years ago as a student, in a moment of boredom and desperation, he wrote a final examination in the form of a rhymed poem. He got an “A.” In CIT 360, we were encouraged to be creative with our programs and assignments. I felt that I grew here because I could express my creativity.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, I feel that I developed not only in CIT but also a person. I could conqueror my fears of no direction for a class and finish it, and I was able to develop relationships with my classmates. I also grew in programming skills and concepts, which will be extremely useful in the real world. Even though this class was one of the most challenging, I was able to learn and grow from it and come out of the Ophelia Syndrome. </p>
